If the database always applies writes in the same order, reads always see
a consistent prefix, so this anomaly cannot happen. However, in many distributed different partitions operate independently, so there is no global ordering of
writes: when a user reads from the database, they may see some parts of the database
in an older state and some in a newer state.

One solution is to make sure that any writes that are causally related to each other are
written to the same partitionâ€”but in some applications that cannot be done efficiently.
There are also algorithms that explicitly keep track of causal dependencies
